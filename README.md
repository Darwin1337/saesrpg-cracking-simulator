SAES:RPG Bank Cracking Simulator  

## Main Information

Coded this application using VS 2017 and BunifuUI (cracked due to monetary reasons).  
This application simulates the bank robbery system present at a Multi Theft Auto game server, SAES:RPG (https://saesrpg.uk/). It enables players to practice their cracking skills offline.  

## How it works

A number is generated between 1 and X (1 000 000 by default) and the user has to guess which number was generated by controlling the guesses with the information displayed on the app (lower or higher).  

## Features

1. Ability to change the maximum generated number.
2. Ability to view the generated number.
3. Counter for how many guesses the user has made.
4. Information for the trustworthiness of the crack, "Reliable crack" (if the user viewed the number an X is displayed).
5. Timer for the crack.
